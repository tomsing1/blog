Welcome to Thomas Sandmann's blog. Originally from Germany, my professional
journey includes a degree in Biochemistry, a PhD in Developmental Biology
from [EMBL](https://www.embl.org/), postdoctoral research at
[Temasek Lifescience Laboratories](http://www.tll.org.sg/) and at the
[German Cancer research Center](https://www.dkfz.de/en/index.html). Afterwards,
I worked as a Computational Biologist at [Genentech](https://www.gene.com/)
and [Verily](https://verily.com/). In 2016 I joined
[Denali Therapeutics](https://www.denalitherapeutics.com/), where I am 
collaborating with colleagues across the organization to generate, analyze and
understand genomics & genetics data.

This blog collects the personal lessons I am learning along the way. <br>
