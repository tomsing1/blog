    "section": "",
    "text": "Today I learned how to configure and refresh these credentials in the command line, as well how to export them either as environmental variables or write them to the credentials file where tools that do not interact with AWS SSO natively can access them.\n\nConfiguring an AWS SSO profile\nFirst, we need to configure a named profile for use with AWS SSO. The following AWS CLI version 2 command will interactively walk you through the necessary steps:\naws configure sso\nThe information you provide will be written to the config file, located in the ~/.aws directory on Mac OS. Here is an example:\n[profile my-dev-profile]\nsso_start_url = https://my-sso-portal.awsapps.com/start\nsso_region = us-east-1\nsso_account_id = 123456789011\nsso_role_name = readOnly\nregion = us-west-2\noutput = json\n\n\nLogging into the AWS SSO profile\nNow we can log into AWS SSO and request temporary credentials:\naws sso login --profile my-dev-profile\nThis command will try to open a web browser for you and prompt you to confirm the login. Alternatively, you can copy & paste the displayed URL and manually enter the confirmation code output by the command.\nIf the login was successful, you can now adopt the my-dev-profile when using the AWS CLI, e.g.\naws s3 ls --profile my-dev-profile\nThe AWS SSO endpoint recognizes many environmental variables that you can use to specify defaults, e.g.\n\nAWS_PROFILE: The profile to use (e.g. my-dev-profile)\nAWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE: the location of the shared credentials files (default on Mac OS: ~/.aws/.credentials)\nAWS_CONFIG_FILE: the location of the AWS CLI configuration file (default on Mac OS: ~/.aws.config)\n\n\n\nAccessing temporary credentials\nThe AWS CLI and many of the AWS SKDs will automatically detect and use SSO credentials. But other tools might not (yet) be compatible with this authentication route. Instead, they might\n\nread credentials for a profile from the credentials file\nrely on environmental variables, e.g. AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\n\nTo expose the temporary credentials, Ben Kehoe has made the aws-export-credentials tool available.\n\n\nInstalling aws-export-credentials\nThe recommended way to install aws-export-credentials is via pipx because it will automatically make it available in your PATH.\n\nIf you don’t have pipx available on your system, install it first.\nNext, install aws-export-credentials by executing the following steps in your shell:\n\npipx ensurepath  # in case you haven't run this before\npipx install aws-export-credentials\naws-export-credentials --version  # verify the installation\n\n\nUpdating the credentials file\nAt the beginning of your workday - or whenever needed - run the following set of commands. (Replace the SSO profile with the one you want to adopt.)\nPROFILE=\"my-dev-profile\"\n\n# retrieve new credentials from AWS\naws sso login --profile \"${PROFILE}\"\n\n# write the temporary credentials to the ~/.aws/credentials file\naws-export-credentials \\\n  --profile \"${PROFILE}\" \\\n  --credentials-file-profile \"${PROFILE}\"\nThis will refresh the credentials (via aws sso login) and then write them to the my-dev-profile profiles in the ~/.aws/.credentials file. Now we can access them e.g. in the aws.s3 R package:\nlibrary(aws.s3)\nlibrary(aws.signature)\naws.signature::use_credentials(profile = \"my-dev-profile\")\naws.s3::bucketlist()\n\n\nExposing environmental variables\nSome tools only recognize environmental variables. Luckily, aws-export-credentials can automate this process, too:\nexport $(aws-export-credentials --profile my-dev-profile --env-export)\nwill export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY variables in your shell session.\n\n\nSourcing credentials with an external process\nFinally, you can also include a command that looks up credentials as a credential_process in your config file. (More information here) But that’s not a use case I have explored, yet."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Fujita et al, Figure 1A/B: (A) Schema of the study. (B) UMAP visualization of 1,509,626 nuclei from 424 donors. Each of the seven major cell types is labeled with a different color.”\n\n\n\nThis large sample size enabled them to assess the effect of genetic variation (e.g. single-nucleotide variants) on gene expression - one cell type at a time. The authors created pseudo-bulk gene expression profiles for each patient for 7 cell types and 81 cell subtypes.\nBecause neurons are highly abundant in the DLPFC, the largest number of nuclei originated from neurons, and the statistical power to detect eQTLs was lower in rarer cell types (e.g. microglia). This highlights the potential of enrichment methods, e.g. by fluorescent activate nuclei sorting (FANS) approached. (See e.g. (Kamath et al. 2022), who specifically enriched dopaminergic neurons or (Sadick et al. 2022), who enriched astrocytes and oligodendrocytes.)\nFujita et al were able to identify ~ 10,000 eGenes1, about half of which were shared across cell types. For example, they identified a novel eQTL (rs128648) for the APOE gene specifically in microglia.\nHaving identified novel eQTL relationships in vivo, the authors then used bulk RNA-seq measurements from a panel of induced pluripotent stem cells that had been differentiated either into neurons (iNeurons) or astrocytes (iAstrocytes) to test whether they could also observe the variants’ effects in vitro.\nDespite a relatively small sample size, a subset of eQTLs were replicated. But the the authors also point out unexpected discrepancies in the MAPT locus where they observed variant effects in the opposite direction from what they had observed by snRNA-seq.\nGene expression was significantly heritable in most cell types (except for those from which only small numbers of nuclei had been sampled). This allowed the authors to use their snRNA-seq dataset to impute cell type specific gene expression for large GWAS studies, e.g. for Alzheimer’s Disease, ALS, Parkinson’s Disease, and schizophrenia. This TWAS analysis detected e.g. 48 novel loci associated with AD in microglia, 22 of which had not been implicated previously.\nIn summary, this work by Fujita et al is an impressive achievement, demonstrating that single-cell/single-nuclei approaches have now become sufficiently scalable to power human genetics analyses.\nThe authors have already made the raw data for their study available on the AD Knowledge Portal.

    "text": "To start learning nextflow, I worked through Andrew Severin’s excellent Creating a NextFlow workflow tutorial. (The tutorial follows the older DSL1 specification of nextflow, but only a few small modifications were needed to run it under DSL2.)\nThe DSL2 code I wrote is here and these are notes I took while working through the tutorial:\n\nTo make a variable a pipeline parameter prepend it with params., then specify them in the command line:\nmain.nf:\n#! /usr/bin/env nextflow\nparams.query=\"file.fasta\"\nprintln \"Querying file $params.query\"\nshell command:\nnextflow run main.nf --query other_file.fasta\nThe -log argument directs logging to the specified file.\nnextflow -log nextflo.log run main.nf \nTo clean up intermediate files automatically upon workflow completion, use the cleanup parameter within a profile.\nprofiles {\n  standard {\n      cleanup = true\n  }\n  debug {\n      cleanup = false\n  }\n}\n\nBy convention the standard profile is implicitly used when no other\nprofile is specified by the user.\nCleaning up intermediate files precludes the use of -resume.\n\nThe nextflow.config file sets the global parameters, e.g.\n\nprocess\nmanifest\nexecutor\nprofiles\ndocker\nsingularity\ntimeline\nreport\netc\n\nContents of the work folder for a nextflow task:\n\n.command.begin is the begin script if you have one\n.command.err is useful when it crashes.\n.command.run is the full nextflow pipeline that was run, this is helpful when trouble shooting a nextflow error rather than the script error.\n.command.sh shows what was run.\n.exitcode will have the exit code in it.\n\nDisplaying help messages\nmain.nf\ndef helpMessage() {\nlog.info \"\"\"\n      Usage:\n      The typical command for running the pipeline is as follows:\n      nextflow run main.nf --query QUERY.fasta --dbDir \"blastDatabaseDirectory\" --dbName \"blastPrefixName\"\n\n      Mandatory arguments:\n       --query                        Query fasta file of sequences you wish to BLAST\n       --dbDir                        BLAST database directory (full path required)\n       [...]\n\"\"\"\n}\n\n// Show help message\nif (params.help) {\n    helpMessage()\n    exit 0\n}\nshell command:\nnextflow run main.nf --help\nThe publishDir directive accepts arguments like mode and pattern to fine tune its behavior, e.g.\noutput:\nfile(\"${label}/short_summary.specific.*.txt\")\npublishDir \"${params.outdir}/BUSCOResults/${label}/\", mode: 'copy', pattern: \"${label}/short_summary.specific.*.txt\"\nDSL2 allows piping, e.g.\nworkflow {\n  res = Channel\n      .fromPath(params.query)\n      .splitFasta(by: 1, file:true) |\n      runBlast\n  res.collectFile(name: 'blast_output_combined.txt', storeDir: params.outdir)\n}\nAdd a timeline report to the output with\ntimeline {\n    enabled = true\n    file = \"$params.outdir/timeline.html\"\n}\n(in nextflow.config).\nAdd a detailed execution report with\nreport {\nenabled = true\nfile = \"$params.outdir/report.html\"\n}\n(in nextflow.config).\nInclude a profile-specific configuration file\nnextflow.config\nprofiles {\n    slurm { includeConfig './configs/slurm.config' }\n}\nconfigs/slurm.config\nprocess {\n    executor = 'slurm'\n    clusterOptions =  '-N 1 -n 16 -t 24:00:00'\n}\nand use it via nextflow run main.nf -profile slurm\nSimilarly, refer to a test profile, specified in a separate file:\nnextflow.config\ntest { includeConfig './configs/test.config' }\nAdding a manifest to nextflow.config\nmanifest {\n    name = 'isugifNF/tutorial'\n    author = 'Andrew Severin'\n    homePage = 'www.bioinformaticsworkbook.org'\n    description = 'nextflow bash'\n    mainScript = 'main.nf'\n    version = '1.0.0'\n}\nUsing a label for a process allows granular control of a process’ configuration\nmain.nf\nprocess runBlast { \n    label 'blast'\n}\nnextflow.config\nprocess {\n    executor = 'slurm'\n    clusterOptions =  '-N 1 -n 16 -t 02:00:00'\n    withLabel: blast { module = 'blast-plus' }\n}\n\nThe label has to be placed before the input section.\n\nLoading a module specifically for a process\nprocess runBlast {\n\n    module = 'blast-plus'\n    publishDir \"${params.outdir}/blastout\"\n\n    input:\n    path queryFile from queryFile_ch\n    .\n    .\n    . // these three dots mean I didn't paste the whole process.\n}\nEnabling docker in the nextflow.config\ndocker { docker.enabled = true }\n\nThe docker container can be specified in the process, e.g.\n\ncontainer = 'ncbi/blast'\nor\ncontainer = `quay.io/biocontainers/blast/2.2.31--pl526he19e7b1_5`\n\nWe can include additional options to pass to the container as well:\n\ncontainerOptions = \"--bind $launchDir/$params.outdir/config:/augustus/config\"\nprojectDir refers to the directory where the main workflow script is located. (It used to be called baseDir.)\nRefering to local directories from within a docker container: create a channel\n\nWorking in containers, we need a way to pass the database file location directly into the runBlast process without the need of the local path.\n\nRepeating a process over each element of a channel with each: input repeaters\nTurning a queue channel into a value channel, which can be used multiple times.\n\nA value channel is implicitly created by a process when it is invoked with a simple value.\nA value channel is also implicitly created as output for a process whose inputs are all value channels.\nA queue channel can be converted into a value channel by returning a single value, using e.g. first, last, collect, count, min, max, reduce, sum, etc. For example: the runBlast process receives three inputs in the following example:\n\nthe queryFile_ch queue channel, with multiple sequences.\nthe dbDir_ch value channel, created by calling .first(), which is reused for all elements of queryFile_ch\nthe dbName_ch value channel, which is also reused for all elements of queryFile_ch\n\n\nworkflow {\n  channel.fromPath(params.dbDir).first()\n  .set { dbDir_ch }\n\n  channel.from(params.dbName).first()\n  .set { dbName_ch }\n\n  queryFile_ch = channel\n      .fromPath(params.query)\n      .splitFasta(by: 1, file:true)\n     res = runBlast(queryFile_ch, dbDir_ch, dbName_ch)\n  res.collectFile(name: 'blast_output_combined.txt', storeDir: params.outdir)\n}\n\n\nAdditional resources\n\nSoftware Carpentry course\nNextflow cheat sheet\nAwesome nextflow"

To perform full-text search, both the records to search and our query need to be tokinzed first, with the to_tsvector and to_tsquery functions, respectively.\nHere is an example of the tokens that are generated:\n\nsql <- glue_sql(\n  \"SELECT to_tsvector('This is a my test phrase, and what \n                       a beautiful phrase it is.')\n   to_tsquery\", con = con)\nDBI::dbGetQuery(con, sql)\n\n                          to_tsquery\n1 'beauti':10 'phrase':6,11 'test':5\n\n\nThe following query correctly returns all records whose descriptions contain the word data:\n\n# search the description field\nterm <- \"data\"\nsql <- glue_sql(\n  \"SELECT id, name\n  FROM datasets\n  WHERE to_tsvector(description) @@ to_tsquery('english', {term})\n  ORDER BY created;\",\n  .con = con)\nDBI::dbGetQuery(con, sql)\n\n  id     name\n1  1   mtcars\n2  3 attitude\n\n\nWe can enrich the output by returning the output of the ts_headline function, highlighting the location / context of the the matched term:\n\n# search the description field and show the matching location\nterm <- \"data\"\nsql <- glue_sql(\n  \"SELECT id, name,\n    ts_headline(description, to_tsquery('english', {term}),\n     'StartSel = <,\n      StopSel = >,\n      MinWords = 5,\n      MaxWords = 7,\n      MaxFragments = 1')\n  FROM datasets\n  WHERE to_tsvector(description) @@ to_tsquery('english', {term})\n  ORDER BY created;\",\n  .con = con)\nDBI::dbGetQuery(con, sql)\n\n  id     name                                            ts_headline\n1  1   mtcars               <data> was extracted from the 1974 Motor\n2  3 attitude financial organization, the <data> are aggregated from\n\n\nWe can also combine search terms, e.g. searching for either employee or motor terms:\n\n# using multiple search terms\nterm <- \"employee | motor\"  # OR\nsql <- glue_sql(\n  \"SELECT id, name,\n  ts_headline(description, to_tsquery('english', {term}),\n     'StartSel = <,\n      StopSel = >,\n      MinWords = 5,\n      MaxWords = 7,\n      MaxFragments = 1')\n  FROM datasets\n  WHERE to_tsvector(description) @@ to_tsquery('english', {term})\n  ORDER BY created;\",\n  .con = con)\nDBI::dbGetQuery(con, sql)\n\n  id     name                                            ts_headline\n1  1   mtcars                from the 1974 <Motor> Trend US magazine\n2  3 attitude clerical <employees> of a large financial organization\n\n\nSimilarly, we can narrow our search by requiring both data and employee terms to appear in the same description:\n\nterm <- \"data & employee\"  # AND\nsql <- glue_sql(\n  \"SELECT id, name,\n  ts_headline(description, to_tsquery('english', {term}),\n     'StartSel = <,\n      StopSel = >,\n      MinWords = 5,\n      MaxWords = 7,\n      MaxFragments = 1')\n  FROM datasets\n  WHERE to_tsvector(description) @@ to_tsquery('english', {term})\n  ORDER BY created;\",\n  .con = con)\nDBI::dbGetQuery(con, sql)\n\n  id     name                                            ts_headline\n1  3 attitude clerical <employees> of a large financial organization"

Let’s create a new column search_description_text:\n\n# create a column to hold tokens for full text search\nsql <- glue_sql(\n  \"ALTER TABLE datasets\n   ADD COLUMN search_description_text tsvector;\", \n  .con = con)\nDBI::dbExecute(con, sql)\n\n[1] 0\n\nDBI::dbListFields(con, \"datasets\")\n\n[1] \"id\"                      \"name\"                   \n[3] \"title\"                   \"description\"            \n[5] \"created\"                 \"search_description_text\"\n\n\nNext, we tokenize the descriptions field, and store the output in our new search_description_text column:\n\nsql <- glue_sql(\n  \"UPDATE datasets\n   SET search_description_text = to_tsvector('english', description);\", \n  .con = con)\nDBI::dbExecute(con, sql)\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nHere are the tokens generated from the description of the first record, for example:\n\nDBI::dbGetQuery(con, \n                \"SELECT name, search_description_text from datasets LIMIT 1;\")\n\n    name\n1 mtcars\n                                                                                                                                                                                          search_description_text\n1 '10':17 '1973':27 '1974':7 '32':25 '74':28 'aspect':18 'automobil':20,26 'compris':13 'consumpt':15 'data':2 'design':21 'extract':4 'fuel':14 'magazin':11 'model':29 'motor':8 'perform':23 'trend':9 'us':10\n\n\nAs before, we can add an index - but this time, we index the pre-tokenized search_description_text column instead:\n\n# create the search index\nsql <- glue_sql(\n  \"CREATE INDEX search_description_idx\n   ON datasets\n   USING gin(search_description_text);\",\n  .con = con)\nDBI::dbExecute(con, sql)\n\n[1] 0\n\n\nTime to run our search again. When we search the search_description_text field, we can omit the to_tsvector() call, because its has been tokenized already:\n\n# search the description field and show the matching location\nterm <- \"data\"\nsql <- glue_sql(\n  \"SELECT id, name,\n  ts_headline(description, to_tsquery('english', {term}),\n     'StartSel = <,\n      StopSel = >,\n      MinWords = 5,\n      MaxWords = 7,\n      MaxFragments = 1')\n  FROM datasets\n  WHERE search_description_text @@ to_tsquery('english', {term})\n  ORDER BY created;\",\n  .con = con)\nDBI::dbGetQuery(con, sql)\n\n  id     name                                            ts_headline\n1  1   mtcars               <data> was extracted from the 1974 Motor\n2  3 attitude financial organization, the <data> are aggregated from\n3  4     euro                     <data> set euro contains the value\n\n\n🚨 But beware: because we have precalculated the tokens, any new records added to the database will not automatically be processed, nor will they be indexed!\nLet’s add a final record, the morely dataset:\n\nmore_data = list(\n  name = \"morley\", \n  title = \"The built-in morley dataset from the datasets R package\",\n  description = gsub(\n    \"\\r?\\n|\\r\", \" \", \n    \"A classical data of Michelson (but not this one with Morley) on \nmeasurements done in 1879 on the speed of light. The data consists of five \nexperiments, each consisting of 20 consecutive ‘runs’. The response is the speed\nof light measurement, suitably coded (km/sec, with 299000 subtracted).\")\n)\n\nTo enter this record, we not only have to populate the name, title and description fields - but also the list of tokens derived from the description in the search_description_text column. In other words, we have to execute the to_tsvector function inside our INSERT statement:\n\nsql <- glue_sql(\n  \"INSERT INTO datasets ({`names(dataset)`*}, search_description_text)\n   VALUES ({more_data*}, to_tsvector({more_data[['description']]}));\", \n  .con = con)\nDBI::dbExecute(con, sql)\n\n[1] 1\n\n\nNow, our query returns both the original matches and the new record:\n\n# search the description field and show the matching location\nterm <- \"data\"\nsql <- glue_sql(\n  \"SELECT id, name,\n  ts_headline(description, to_tsquery('english', {term}),\n     'StartSel = <,\n      StopSel = >,\n      MinWords = 5,\n      MaxWords = 7,\n      MaxFragments = 1')\n  FROM datasets\n  WHERE search_description_text @@ to_tsquery('english', {term})\n  ORDER BY created;\",\n  .con = con)\nDBI::dbGetQuery(con, sql)\n\n  id     name                                            ts_headline\n1  1   mtcars               <data> was extracted from the 1974 Motor\n2  3 attitude financial organization, the <data> are aggregated from\n3  4     euro                     <data> set euro contains the value\n4  5   morley            classical <data> of Michelson (but not this\n\n\n\n\nChoosing between indexing strategies\nAccording to the Postgres documentation:\n\nOne advantage of the separate-column approach over an expression index is that it is not necessary to explicitly specify the text search configuration in queries in order to make use of the index. Another advantage is that searches will be faster, since it will not be necessary to redo the to_tsvector calls to verify index matches. The expression-index approach is simpler to set up, however, and it requires less disk space since the tsvector representation is not stored explicitly.\n\nThat’s it.

    "text": "In this document, I am experimenting with various attributes that organize the layout, size and placement of figures of Quarto document. For more details, please check out the official documentation, especially the topics on figures and article layout.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFor illustration, I am displaying both the code that generates a simple plot as well as the attributes that determine how it is rendered, e.g. the ::: tags interspersed with the code blocks, and the #| attributes within individual code cells. See the documentation on executable blocks for details.\n\n\nFirst, let’s generate a simple plot, so we can see the effect of different attributes on how it is rendered in subsequent code cells.\nTo start, we render the output without specifying any custom attributes, e.g. using the default settings for this Quarto website:\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ntheme_set(theme_linedraw(base_size = 14))\np <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = drat)) + \n  geom_point(color = \"skyblue\", size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", formula = 'y ~ x', se = FALSE) +\n  theme(panel.grid = element_blank())\np\n\n\n\n\n\nWidth and height of individual figures\nThe fig-width and fig-height attributes specify the dimensions of the image file that is generated. The out-width attribute determines the size at which that image is displayed in the rendered HTML page.\n#| fig-width: 4\n#| figh-height: 5\n#| out-width: \"50%\"\n#| fig-align: \"center\"\n\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, the same image can be displayed at 50% of the width of the enclosing <div>.\n#| fig-width: 4\n#| figh-height: 5\n#| out-width: \"25%\"\n#| fig-align: \"center\"\n\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLayout: columns and rows\nThe layout-ncol and layout-nrow attributes govern the placement of multiple figures within the same element. For example, we can place two figures next to each other, in two column.\nThe fig-align attributes specify the figure alignment within each column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe out-width attribute is always relative to its enclosing element, e.g. here out-width: \"50%\" refers to half of the width of a column, not the page width.\n\n\n::: {layout-ncol=2}\n\n\n\n#| out-width: \"50%\"\n#| fig-align: \"center\"\n\n\n#| out-width: \"30%\"\n#| fig-align: \"right\"\n\n\n\n\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\nTabsets\nTabsets can be used to organize contents, e.g. by hiding content until the other clicks on the tab’s header.\nThe layout of the first tabset contains just one column and row.\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\npanel 1panel 2\n\n\n\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second panel is subdivided into two columns. (Note the use of the :::: tag, nested within the ::: parent tag.)\n:::: {layout-ncol=2}\n\n\n\np\n\n\n\n\n\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::"
