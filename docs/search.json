    "section": "",
    "text": "Today I learned how to configure and refresh these credentials in the command line, as well how to export them either as environmental variables or write them to the credentials file where tools that do not interact with AWS SSO natively can access them.\n\nConfiguring an AWS SSO profile\nFirst, we need to configure a named profile for use with AWS SSO. The following AWS CLI version 2 command will interactively walk you through the necessary steps:\naws configure sso\nThe information you provide will be written to the config file, located in the ~/.aws directory on Mac OS. Here is an example:\n[profile my-dev-profile]\nsso_start_url = https://my-sso-portal.awsapps.com/start\nsso_region = us-east-1\nsso_account_id = 123456789011\nsso_role_name = readOnly\nregion = us-west-2\noutput = json\n\n\nLogging into the AWS SSO profile\nNow we can log into AWS SSO and request temporary credentials:\naws sso login --profile my-dev-profile\nThis command will try to open a web browser for you and prompt you to confirm the login. Alternatively, you can copy & paste the displayed URL and manually enter the confirmation code output by the command.\nIf the login was successful, you can now adopt the my-dev-profile when using the AWS CLI, e.g.\naws s3 ls --profile my-dev-profile\nThe AWS SSO endpoint recognizes many environmental variables that you can use to specify defaults, e.g.\n\nAWS_PROFILE: The profile to use (e.g. my-dev-profile)\nAWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE: the location of the shared credentials files (default on Mac OS: ~/.aws/.credentials)\nAWS_CONFIG_FILE: the location of the AWS CLI configuration file (default on Mac OS: ~/.aws.config)\n\n\n\nAccessing temporary credentials\nThe AWS CLI and many of the AWS SKDs will automatically detect and use SSO credentials. But other tools might not (yet) be compatible with this authentication route. Instead, they might\n\nread credentials for a profile from the credentials file\nrely on environmental variables, e.g. AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\n\nTo expose the temporary credentials, Ben Kehoe has made the aws-export-credentials tool available.\n\n\nInstalling aws-export-credentials\nThe recommended way to install aws-export-credentials is via pipx because it will automatically make it available in your PATH.\n\nIf you don’t have pipx available on your system, install it first.\nNext, install aws-export-credentials by executing the following steps in your shell:\n\npipx ensurepath  # in case you haven't run this before\npipx install aws-export-credentials\naws-export-credentials --version  # verify the installation\n\n\nUpdating the credentials file\nAt the beginning of your workday - or whenever needed - run the following set of commands. (Replace the SSO profile with the one you want to adopt.)\nPROFILE=\"my-dev-profile\"\n\n# retrieve new credentials from AWS\naws sso login --profile \"${PROFILE}\"\n\n# write the temporary credentials to the ~/.aws/credentials file\naws-export-credentials \\\n  --profile \"${PROFILE}\" \\\n  --credentials-file-profile \"${PROFILE}\"\nThis will refresh the credentials (via aws sso login) and then write them to the my-dev-profile profiles in the ~/.aws/.credentials file. Now we can access them e.g. in the aws.s3 R package:\nlibrary(aws.s3)\nlibrary(aws.signature)\naws.signature::use_credentials(profile = \"my-dev-profile\")\naws.s3::bucketlist()\n\n\nExposing environmental variables\nSome tools only recognize environmental variables. Luckily, aws-export-credentials can automate this process, too:\nexport $(aws-export-credentials --profile my-dev-profile --env-export)\nwill export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY variables in your shell session.\n\n\nSourcing credentials with an external process\nFinally, you can also include a command that looks up credentials as a credential_process in your config file. (More information here) But that’s not a use case I have explored, yet."

    "text": "Fujita et al, Figure 1A/B: (A) Schema of the study. (B) UMAP visualization of 1,509,626 nuclei from 424 donors. Each of the seven major cell types is labeled with a different color.”\n\n\n\nThis large sample size enabled them to assess the effect of genetic variation (e.g. single-nucleotide variants) on gene expression - one cell type at a time. The authors created pseudo-bulk gene expression profiles for each patient for 7 cell types and 81 cell subtypes.\nBecause neurons are highly abundant in the DLPFC, the largest number of nuclei originated from neurons, and the statistical power to detect eQTLs was lower in rarer cell types (e.g. microglia). This highlights the potential of enrichment methods, e.g. by fluorescent activate nuclei sorting (FANS) approached. (See e.g. (Kamath et al. 2022), who specifically enriched dopaminergic neurons or (Sadick et al. 2022), who enriched astrocytes and oligodendrocytes.)\nFujita et al were able to identify ~ 10,000 eGenes1, about half of which were shared across cell types. For example, they identified a novel eQTL (rs128648) for the APOE gene specifically in microglia.\nHaving identified novel eQTL relationships in vivo, the authors then used bulk RNA-seq measurements from a panel of induced pluripotent stem cells that had been differentiated either into neurons (iNeurons) or astrocytes (iAstrocytes) to test whether they could also observe the variants’ effects in vitro.\nDespite a relatively small sample size, a subset of eQTLs were replicated. But the the authors also point out unexpected discrepancies in the MAPT locus where they observed variant effects in the opposite direction from what they had observed by snRNA-seq.\nGene expression was significantly heritable in most cell types (except for those from which only small numbers of nuclei had been sampled). This allowed the authors to use their snRNA-seq dataset to impute cell type specific gene expression for large GWAS studies, e.g. for Alzheimer’s Disease, ALS, Parkinson’s Disease, and schizophrenia. This TWAS analysis detected e.g. 48 novel loci associated with AD in microglia, 22 of which had not been implicated previously.\nIn summary, this work by Fujita et al is an impressive achievement, demonstrating that single-cell/single-nuclei approaches have now become sufficiently scalable to power human genetics analyses.\nThe authors have already made the raw data for their study available on the AD Knowledge Portal.
