Whenever I deal with nested lists in R - e.g. after reading JSON documents - my code starts to resemble a jumbled mess of `lapply` calls. (Or, on a better day,
a horrible collection of 
[purrr::map](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/reference/map.html) 
calls). 

Luckily, there is help: the 
[rlist R package](https://renkun-ken.github.io/rlist-tutorial/index.html) 
offers lots of great functionality to extract, combine, filter, select and convert nested lists. It works with JSON arrays / files out of the box as well, so it's super useful when you deal with the response from REST APIs, for example. 

Available from a 
[your nearest CRAN mirror](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rlist/index.html).

Check it out, you won't regret it!
