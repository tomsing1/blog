Do you use conda (or miniconda) to install software? Then I have good news: 
[conda is going to become much faster!](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/conda-is-fast-now)

To take advantage of the speed-ups implemented in the latest conda release, 
you need to update your conda installation (if you already have one):

```
conda info
conda update -n base conda
```

and then switch to the new dependency solver:

```
conda install -n base conda-libmamba-solver
conda config --set solver libmamba
```

That's it - enjoy parallelized downloads & faster installations!
