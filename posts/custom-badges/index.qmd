Today I learned how to create custom badges with [shields.io](https://img.shields.io), 
and how to add them to the `README.md` file on github.

### Predefined badges

Many open source software packages display key pieces of information as
badges (aka shields) in their github README, indicating e.g. code coverage,
unit test results, version numbers, license, etc.

The [shields.io](https://img.shields.io) website provides many different
ready-to-use badges, covering topics such as 
[test results](https://shields.io/category/test-results), 
[code coverage](https://shields.io/category/coverage),
[social media logos](https://shields.io/category/social), 
[activity](https://shields.io/category/activity),
and many more.

![](https://shields.io/badge/Watch-96-lightgrey?logo=github&style=social)

Badges can show up to date information. For example, this badge shows the last
commit to the 
[github repository for this blog](https://github.com/tomsing1/blog):
![](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/tomsing1/blog)

Badges can be returned either in `svg` (recommended) or `png` formats, from
the `img.shields.io` and `raster.shields.io` servers, respectively.

### Custom badges

In addition to predefined outputs, you can also generate your own, entirely
custom badges. They can be static like this one
![](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Static&message=My%20static%20badge&color=blue&style=flat-square)
or dynamically retrieve information from
[a JSON endpoint of your choice](https://shields.io/endpoint).

### Adding badges to a README.md file

To embed badges into your `README.md`, simply wrap its URL in
markdown and surround it with the `badges: start` and `badges: end` tags:

```
<!-- badges: start -->
![](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/tomsing1/blog)
<!-- badges: end -->
```
