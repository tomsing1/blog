Today I learned about
[Grav](https://getgrav.org/),
a lightweight content-management system,
from [danwwilson](https://fosstodon.org/@Danwwilson/110748191305268643).
Grav is based on flat files, e.g. it does not require a database, and 
automatically renders pages written in markdown. 

The optional 
[admin plugin](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-admin)
includes user management, 2-factor authentication and more.

Definitely something I will keep in mind, e.g. to distribute analysis results
within an organization.
