## tl;dr

This week I learned how to analyze CITE-seq data, e.g. transcriptome and 
surface-protein levels measured simultaneously for the same single cells.

To learn how gene expression and protein markers can be combined to identify
cell sub-types, I reanalyzed a dataset published by 
[Lee et al, Nature Communications, 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-27232-5),
starting with raw sequencing reads.

## Overview

In 2021, 
[Lee et al](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-27232-5)
characterized the gene expression landscape of mouse B-cells, performing
[CITE-seq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CITE-Seq) 
on B cells collected from bone marrow of two wildtype C57BL/6 mice.

First, the authors enriched B-cells using fluorescent activated cell sorting
(FACS) with antibodies detecting the B220 of the CD45 protein (encoded by the
[PTPRC gene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTPRC)), a pan B-cell marker in mice
[^1]. To capture both naive and mature cells, they retained equal numbers of 
B-cells positive or negative for CD43 staining [^2]

[^1]: The field of immunology has identified a large number of cell type
specific markers, which are often used in combination to define granular
cell subtypes. Confusingly, despite having the same names in humans and mice,
the cell type distribution of many markers differs between species. See
[Figure 3 by Weisel et al, Nat Immunology, 2022 ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8712407/figure/F3/)
for a helpful overview of human and mouse B-cell markers.

[^2]: In mice, CD43 (aka sialophorin) is expressed on pro–B cells, plasma cells,
peritoneal and spleen CD5+ B cells (B-1 cells), but not on resting, conventional
peripheral B cells.

B-cells from each mouse were first incubated with different 
oligonucleotide-tagged "cell hashing" antibodies, and then combined into a
single pool. Afterwards, the cells were stained with additional oligo-tagged
"feature detection" antibodies recognizing B-cell surface markers. Finally, 
both the intracellular transcriptome and the presence of the antibody markers
were read out using single-cell RNA-seq capture on the 10X Genomics 
microfluidics platform.

### Cell staining - details

Bone marrow cells from two 8-week-old wild-type mice were each stained
with 

- 2 different hashtag antibodies (one for each mouse)
- 5 CITE-seq antibodies (targeting surface proteins)
- 2 fluorescently labelled antibodies (B220/CD45R and CD43) used for
  FACS enrichment of B-cells. 
    - Both B220+,CD43+  and B220+/CD43- populations were captured and mixed at a
      1:1 ratio to enrich for all early progenitor B-cell subsets. 

This strategy captures the vast majority of developing B cells in the bone
marrow  but does exclude a small fraction of developing CD19+ B cells that
express  CD11c, Ly6G, or NK1.1.

## Data availability

The authors made all of the raw sequencing data and processed count matrices 
available via NCBI's GEO repository as 
[serices GSE168158](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE168158).

They performed their own analysis with 10X Genomics' `cellranger` software
(version 3.1.0), aligning the reads to the `mm10` version of the mouse genome.
Downstream processing was performed using various R/Bioconductor packages.

Here, I am performing a re-analysis of the raw data with the latest available
version of `cellranger` (version 8.0.1) and the latest reference genome (GRCm39,
Ensembl version 110).

## Retrieving the raw data

The
[ENA repository](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home)
mirrors data available from the SRA - and it offers FASTQ files for download via
FTP.
(SRA also has cloud delivery options for FASTQ files, but I prefer a simple FTP
download).

The download links are shown in the table at the bottom of 
[ENA's browser page for this project](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA706373).

I really like to use 
[rclone](https://rclone.org/)
as my "swiss army knife" to transfer files between remote and / or local sources.

First, I set up a new `ena` _remote_ for the ENA ftp server 
(`ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk`) with the interactive `rclone config` command (username:
`anonymous`, password: `anonymous`). Next, I copy the folders for each of the
three runs (each with 2 FASTQ files - R1 and R2) to my local machine.

Finally, because `cellranger` expects filename with a specific pattern, I rename
them afterwards.

```bash
mkdir -p fastq
pushd fastq

# interactively configure FTP remote for ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk called `ena`
# rclone config 

# transfer the files for the three runs
rclone copy -v ena://vol1/fastq/SRR138/085/SRR13847285/ .
rclone copy -v ena://vol1/fastq/SRR138/086/SRR13847286/ .
rclone copy -v ena://vol1/fastq/SRR138/087/SRR13847287/ .

# rename the files according to cellranger's expectations
mv SRR13847285_1.fastq.gz SRR13847285_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz  # gene expression (47 Gb)
mv SRR13847285_2.fastq.gz SRR13847285_S1_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz  # gene expression (114 Gb)
mv SRR13847286_1.fastq.gz SRR13847286_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz  # antibody capture
mv SRR13847286_2.fastq.gz SRR13847286_S1_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz  # antibody capture
mv SRR13847287_1.fastq.gz SRR13847287_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz  # multiplexing capture
mv SRR13847287_2.fastq.gz SRR13847287_S1_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz  # multiplexing capture

popd
```

To process the raw data from this study, I need to consider both the hashtag
antibodies (identifying each cell's animal of origin) and the CITE-seq
antibodies (identifying the detected surface proteins). (The fluorescently
labelled antibodies are not captured in the sequencing library; they determined
which cells were included in the experiment in the first place.)

### Cell hashing antibodies

Lee et al used two hashing antibodies to label cells from two animals:

- [TotalSeq A0301](https://www.biolegend.com/en-gb/products/totalseq-a0301-anti-mouse-hashtag-1-antibody-16103)
    - A mixture of two antibodies recognizing mouse CD45 and MHC class I
    - Barcode sequence: `ACCCACCAGTAAGAC`
- [TotalSeq A0302](https://www.biolegend.com/en-gb/products/totalseq-a0302-anti-mouse-hashtag-2-antibody-16104)
    - The same mixture of antibodies recognizing mouse CD45 and MHC class I, but
      with a different barcode.
    - barcode `GGTCGAGAGCATTCA`
    
Interestingly, in the method section they also mention:

>Four other hashtag samples were present in this experiment and were excluded to derive
only the wildtype B cells.

So they _actually_ combined cells from six different animals and super-loaded a
single 10X genomics lane. (This also explains why the FASTQ files of gene
expression library are so large - they contain 1.2 billion reads.)
Unfortunately, they don't specify what the barcodes of these other four hashing
antibodies were. For a first pass analysis, I will assume that they used the
TotalSeq anti-mouse hashtags 3-6 for the remaining samples, as they used
hashtags 1 and 2 for the two samples of interest.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}

The hashtag barcodes are the first 15 nucleotides of the R2 read. This baroque
bash pipe will list the top 6 most frequent barcodes among the first 100,000
reads - and confirms that the authors indeed used Biolegends hashing antibodies
A0301-A0306.

```
gzip -cd fastq/SRR13847287_S1_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz | \
  grep -A 1 "^@" | \
  grep -v "@" | \
  grep -v "-" | \
  cut -c 1-15 | \
  head -n 100000 | \
  sort | \
  uniq -c | \
  sort -n | \
  tail -n 6

#### Cell hashing reference file

Cellranger was designed to demultiplex cells labelled with 
cholesterol-modified oligonucleotides (CMOs), defined in a 
[CMO reference file](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/using/multi#cmoreference).

To decode the cell hashing antibodies used by Lee et al (the two barcodes
associated with the relevant samples, as well as the four barcodes assigned to
_mystery_ samples not further described in the paper) I provide an analogous
`hashing_reference.csv` configuration file:

```
id,name,read,pattern,sequence,feature_type
A0301,A0301,R2,5P(BC),ACCCACCAGTAAGAC,Multiplexing Capture
A0302,A0302,R2,5P(BC),GGTCGAGAGCATTCA,Multiplexing Capture
A0303,A0303,R2,5P(BC),CTTGCCGCATGTCAT,Multiplexing Capture

A0306,A0306,R2,5P(BC),TATGCTGCCACGGTA,Multiplexing Capture
```

### CITE-Seq antibodies

In addition to the hashing antibodies, the authors also labelled the cells with
oligo-tagged antibodies recognizing the following surface proteins that are
expressed on B-cells:

- anti-B220 / CD45R [TotalSeq A0103](https://www.biolegend.com/en-us/punchout/punchout-products/product-detail/totalseq-a0103-anti-mouse-human-cd45r-b220antibody-15925?GroupID=GROUP658)

  - Clone AA4.1
  - CD93 / C1QR1 is expressed on B cell precursors until the T2 stage, as well
    as  a wide variety of cells such as platelets, monocytes, microglia and 
    endothelial cells.
  - Barcode sequence: `GGTATTTCCTGTGGT`
- anti-CD25/ IL-2Rα [TotalSeq A0097](https://www.biolegend.com/en-gb/products/totalseq-a0097-anti-mouse-cd25-antibody-16233)

  - IL-2Rα is expressed on activated T and B cells, thymocyte subsets, pre-B
    cells, and T regulatory cells
  - Barcode sequence: `ACCATGAGACACAGT`
- anti-IgM [TotalSeq A0450](https://www.biolegend.com/en-gb/products/totalseq-a0450-anti-mouse-igm-antibody-16772)
  - Clone RMM-1
  - Surface IgM is expressed on the majority of mature B cells.
  - Barcode sequence: `AGCTACGCATTCAAT`

#### Feature reference file

The barcode information is provided to `cellranger multi` in the 
`feature_reference.csv`
[file](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/using/feature-bc-analysis#feature-ref):

```

## Running cellranger multi

The current version (8.0.1) of the
[cellranger multi pipeline](https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/software/cell-ranger/latest/analysis/running-pipelines/cr-3p-multi)
can process the three libraries (gene expression, hashtag oligos and CITE-seq oligos) 
together, and automatically demultiplexes hashed samples. 
The `cellranger multi` command requires a set of 
[configuration options](https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/software/cell-ranger/latest/advanced/cr-multi-config-csv-opts),
provided in a CSV file (alongside the hashtag- and feature-configuration files defined
above).

Instructions for analyzing antibody hash tags alongside surface antibody protein
capture data
[are here](https://kb.10xgenomics.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407386498957-I-used-antibody-tags-for-cell-surface-protein-capture-and-cell-hashing-with-Single-Cell-3-chemistry-How-can-I-use-Cell-Ranger-to-analyze-my-data).

I will use the following `config.csv` file, together with the 
`refdata-gex-GRCm39-2024-A` mouse genome reference (and STAR index)
[supplied by 10X Genomics](https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/software/cell-ranger/latest/release-notes/cr-reference-release-notes).

Interestingly, the R1 reads for the gene expression library (SRR13847285) are 26
bp long, but the R1 reads for the hashing and CITE-seq libraries are 28 bp long. 
To avoid a `cellranger` error I set the `r1-length` parameter to 26 for both
gene expression and feature libraries.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}

Cellranger 8.0.1 returned the following error message due to the mismatched
R1 read lenghts: 

>We detected a mixture of different R1 lengths ([26-28]), which breaks
assumptions in how UMIs are tabulated and corrected. To process these data, 
you will need to truncate to the shortest observed R1 length by providing 26 
to the --r1-length argument if are running count/vdj, or via the r1-length 
parameter in each of the following tables of your multi config CSV if you are
running multi: [gene-expression], [feature], [feature]

:::

Note: Only _absolute_ paths are accepted in the `config.csv` file, e.g. the
working directory (`/data/bcells`) needs to be specified in full. (Symbolic
links are not followed, either.)

```
[gene-expression]

```

Now I can start the analysis pipeline with `cellranger` (version 8.0.1) with the
following command:

```bash
cellranger multi --id=B_cells --csv=config.csv
```

## Examining the results
