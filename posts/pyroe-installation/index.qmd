[Alevin-fry](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-022-01408-3)
is a highly accurate and performant method to process single-cell or
single-nuclei RNA-seq data. For downstream processing, its output can be
parsed into R with the
[fishpond::loadFry()](https://rdrr.io/github/mikelove/fishpond/man/loadFry.html)
function. For analysis using python, the 
[pyroe](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/pyroe)
module is available.

It can be installed either using `pip` or `conda`, and the latter will install
additional dependencies (e.g. bedtools) and include the `load_fry()` as well.

To install `pyroe` with conda, I first followed 
[bioconda's instructions](https://bioconda.github.io/)
to add and configure the required channels:

```bash
conda config --add channels defaults
conda config --add channels bioconda
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --set channel_priority strict
```

and then installed `pyroe`

```bash
conda install pyroe
```

Now I can convert `alevin-fry` output to one of the following formats:
`zarr`, `csvs`, `h5ad` or `loom`. 

```bash
pyroe convert --help
```
