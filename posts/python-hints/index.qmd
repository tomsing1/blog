Today I learned about python type hints (again...) as I was tackling the first parts of
[pybites'](https://pybit.es/)
[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
learning track. The following resources were great to get a quick overview:

- [Code Better with Type Hints – Part 1](https://pybit.es/articles/code-better-with-type-hints-part-1/)
- [Code Better with Type Hints – Part 2](https://pybit.es/articles/code-better-with-type-hints-part-2/)
- [FastAPI's typing introduction](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/python-types/)
- [Pysheet: typing](https://www.pythonsheets.com/notes/python-typing.html)
