Today it was time to update the R installation on my Mac OS X system, from R `4.2.1` to
`4.2.2`. Luckily, with [Gábor Csárdi's](https://fosstodon.org/@gaborcsardi)
[rig](https://github.com/r-lib/rig)
command line tool that was a breeze.

I had previously installed `rig` with [brew](https://brew.sh/)

```
brew tap r-lib/rig
brew install --cask rig
```

so I first checked if there were any updates available for `rig` itself:

```
brew upgrade --cask rig
```

This command updated `rig` from version `0.5.0` to `0.5.2`.

Then I listed the R versions currently installed on my system:

```
rig list
  4.1   (R 4.1.3)
* 4.2   (R 4.2.1)
```

At this point, I was using R release 4.2.1. Next, I updated to the latest release

```
rig install

```

Once the `rig install` command had completed, my system had updated itself to R version 
4.2.2:

```
rig list
  4.1   (R 4.1.3)
* 4.2   (R 4.2.2)
``` 

Now a new R session starts with R 4.2.2

```

Thank you, Gábor!
