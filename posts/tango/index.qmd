This week, I worked my way through
[Tango with Django 4](https://www.tangowithdjango.com/),
an introduction to the
[Django web development framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
by [Leif Azzopardi](https://twitter.com/leifos/) and 
[David Maxwell](https://www.dmax.scot/).

Their book offers a great starting point for somebody with a basic background
in python but no experience in web development. I really enjoyed implementing
the `Rango` web application they develop in a systematic, step-by-step fashion.

To follow along, learners have to actually complete the exercises at the end of
each chapter. That's been a very effective learning strategy for me, as opposed
to simply _reading_ a tutorial start to finish. 

The book covers e.g.

- Creating & configuring Django projects from scratch
- Understanding the model -> view -> template workflow
- Creating forms and committing data to a SQLite database backend
- User authentication & management
- etc

Right now, the latest version of the book covers Django version 4, but I was
able to complete the exercises with Djano 5.3 as well (with a little help from
Stackoverflow).

While the first 2/3 of the book was great, it seems that the last chapters
(covering e.g. the Bootstrap CSS framework or implementing search functionality)
may not quite finished, yet. (The 
[book's companiongithub repository](https://github.com/tangowithcode/tango_with_django_4_code) doesn't offer code for the later chapters, either.)

But I am thankful for the easy-to-follow introduction into Django's core
functionality. After all, teaching backend _and_ frontend web development to
beginners might simply be too much to ask for from a single book. So - thank you
Leif and David for teaching me to `Tango with Rango` over the last few days!

Next, I am hoping to learn about styling web applications with 
[bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/)
and, afterwards, taking a deeper dive into javascript (once again).
